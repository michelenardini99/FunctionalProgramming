/*  Exercise 5: 
 *  - Generalise by ad-hoc polymorphism logAll, such that:
 *  -- it can be called on Sequences but also on Optional, or others... 
 *  -- it does not necessarily call log, but any function with analogous type
 *  - Hint: introduce a type class Traversable[T[_]]], capturing the ability of calling a
 *    "consumer function" on all elements (with type A) of a datastructure T[A] 
 *    Note Traversable is a 2-kinded trait (similar to Filterable, or Monad)
 *  - Write givens for Traversable[Optional] and Traversable[Sequence]
 *  - Show you can use the generalisation of logAll to:
 *  -- log all elements of an Optional, or of a Traversable
 *  -- println(_) all elements of an Optional, or of a Traversable
